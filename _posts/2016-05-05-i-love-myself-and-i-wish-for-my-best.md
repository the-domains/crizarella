BE IN THE MOMENT.

Being in the moment is a full-time job. It involves more than just sitting in front of another person or focussing on something. 95 % of your daily time is spent unaware, not being in the moment. You're always busy with something else while you're busy with something else. This is one major reason why so many people feel stressed all the time. Think about it. 

You're having coffee with a friend -- a time-out to relax, smile and catch up. Getting to your friend is a hassle already -- time pressure, traffic jam, a unicorn on the side walk. Finally you arrive and sit down. After a few moments instead of feeling good you're getting twitchy. Your to-do list pops-up in your head, you loose interest in the conversation, you feel hounded. Angrily you look at your friend, it feels like she's stealing your precious time and is boring you to death with stories about her kids and a new cake recipe! You wonder if she doesn't have any sensitivity at all, she should be realizing all the sacrifices you made to be here. Disappointed you get up to hurry to your next appointment. Already late again just because you were so kind to listen to your friend. Day for day, hour for hour, minute for minute, chasing your own life, never arriving, never relaxing, never happy. Never in the moment. Sounds familiar?

Your thoughts are either in the past or in the future. There's only one part of you that is always in the present, because it has no choice: your body. It can't be anywhere else. This is the reason why you feel disrupted and broken. Why you are out of energy. And smiles. It is so hard, tiring and stressful to not be present in the same era as your body. Pretty logical, no?

Relax and slow down. Be aware of the moment. Be there totally. If you're unhappy where you are: remove yourself from the situation, change it or accept it. These are your possibilities. Realize how powerful this is! Create your life out of these moments -- moments to be. One after the other. Do it in a caring and loving way and let happiness guide you. Enjoy the change and try not to be impatient. Life is a tango -- three steps forward, two steps back. But always moving und dancing. 

**The healing energy is with you.**
